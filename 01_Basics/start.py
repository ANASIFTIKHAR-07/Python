x = 10
y = x  # Here the reference of x is given to y
# The concept of mutable datatype is that if we change the value of x, the value of y will be the same
# Because the the y is having the reference of x's 10 value from the storage RAM. 
# And if we change the valuse of x, a new storage will be created in the memory in which the x's new memory will be stores
# The actual reference is the immutable in this case which is stored in the memory.
# In Python, this is the speciality of it, that almost every thing which is created in python is stored in the memory
# as object. and that object is the reference of the variable or any other datatype.
